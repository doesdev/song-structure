## Structuring music can be hard, this aims to ease it a tiny bit
This is a little utility that prompts for the number of beats in the song, beats per measure, desired structure (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Verse...), then distributes those proportionally using pre-set weights for each part type and provides those recommendations.

From there it will print a suggested number of measures and beats each part should get.

Of course music isn't a simple formula, so consider this just some rough suggestions.

# Usage
```sh
# Install globally
$ npm install --global song-structure
```
